# machine-translation-transformer-scratch
## Project Overview

The project implements a custom Transformer model in PyTorch to perform machine language translation between English and Urdu. The model is constructed following the standard Transformer architecture principles, including separate encoder and decoder components, multi-head attention mechanisms, positional encoding, and a final linear projection layer.
## Key Features

- **Custom Transformer Implementation**: Built from scratch using PyTorch, tailored specifically for English to Urdu translation.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Utilizes multi-head attention to capture contextual relationships within and between sentences efficiently.
- **Positional Encoding**: Enhances the model's understanding of token order, critical for maintaining the grammatical structure in translations.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of several key components:
- **Encoder**: Processes the English text, embedding linguistic features into a high-dimensional space.
- **Decoder**: Generates the Urdu translation step-by-step from the encoded representation.
- **Pretrained Tokenizer**: Converts text data into a machine-readable format, facilitating effective model training ("bert-base-multilingual-cased").
